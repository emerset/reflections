>> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use it as a backup, and as a way to work from multiple devices (laptop, desktop, tablet, phone, library computer).
I'd also want to use it if I'm collaberating with other people.
Finally, I'd want to use it to publish my work for my portfolio.

You might be modifying some code and then an update messes up what you're doing

>> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
>> When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are GitHub copies of someone else's repository into your own on GitHub
Clones are repository copies from a GitHub repo into a local computer
Branches are commits made within a repository that do not effect the main line of code

>> What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Then you can make changes and merge whatever you want to locally, and then when you're
happy, push whatever you want into the cloud

>> How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Lots of stuff

>> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use it as a backup, and as a way to work from multiple devices (laptop, desktop, tablet, phone, library computer).
I'd also want to use it if I'm collaberating with other people.
Finally, I'd want to use it to publish my work for my portfolio.

You might be modifying some code and then an update messes up what you're doing

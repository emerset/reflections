Prompt: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

--> I already know this shit. And I don't know ANY advantages of using command line.
--> ONLY disadvantages. It's like walking with a crutch.

Prompt: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
 a more efficient programmer in the long term?

--> I can easily undo and compare version changes. I can also systematically implement changes.

Prompt: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

--> pros: logical separations between commits makes it easier to read through and revert
--> cons: you need to be aware of your changes and commits, as it is not automatic. Could
--> take a bit more time creating code

Prompt: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

--> Git is created to consider multiple files as part of the same unified project, and thus 
--> interconnected. Google Docs treats each file as a stand alone independent project, so it treats
--> each file separately.

Prompt: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

--> git log will give you a list of all the commits within the repository selected.
--> git diff (commidId)(commitId) will give you the lines of difference between two commits.

Prompt: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

--> You can always revert to the way things were if there is any mistake.
--> Like a perfect ctrl+z forever whenever you want.

Prompt: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

--> for programming a website and starting the several app ideas I have, and heck,
--> maybe even working on my tutorial apps

1) Open GitShell
2) type -> ls version-control\reflections
3) type -> notepad++ lesson_1_reflections.txt
4) if notepad++ not recognized, type -> $env:Path = "C:\Program Files(x86)\Notepad++";

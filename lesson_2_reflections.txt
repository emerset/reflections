Prompt: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

--> you need to type git init.
--> a .git file will be created in the directory.

Prompt: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

--> The staging area stores the files that you are interested in committing
--> into the repository for the first time. It is valuable because it offers
--> you the choice of which files you would like to include (and when) into 
--> the repo, instead of just automatically including everything in a directory
